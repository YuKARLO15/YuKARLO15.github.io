            <p>I'm Karlo Robert C. Wagan and I'm currently a first-year BSCS student at Baliuag University. I was born on
                January 15, 2003 at Sagrada Familia Hospital, Tangos, Baliuag, Bulacan. I am the youngest among 4 siblings.
                My father, Roberto C. Wagan was born on January 15, 1955. He was former college professor and is currently
                retired. My mother, Erlinda C. Wagan was born on January 03, 1965. She is currently a elementary school
                principal. I am currently living in Pinaod, San Ildefonso, Bulacan.
            </p><br>
            <p>I like photography and design, even though it's not my forte. I'm currently enrolled in BSCS major in Animation &amp; Game 
                Development. It was because I took interest in making games and especially designing it. Though, throughout my journey at
                BU. I started to took interest to Web Development and Design, as well as Networking. So I'm currently at a dilemma right now. 
                I aim to develop game development skills, web development skills, and design skills. I may as well aim to be a full-stack developer. 
                So far I'm now on a journey to learn and to develop skills. I may also discover new things that will interests me. 
                I'm still learning so, I may not be perfect this time. But I'll try my best. 
                Also I plan to make contents, learn drawing, do photography, and stream.
            </p><br>
            <p>Throughout my childhood, I enjoy cycling and playing games. It was also that time that I learned about computers since we have a 
                family computer and my older brother always plays on it. He introduced me to games like RAN Online and DOTA. 
                Which peaked my interest on computers. I like playing games such as GTA San Andreas, Genshin Impact, and Mobile Legends. 
                I also play games as a child like Habul-Habulan, Tagu-Taguan, and Patintero. 
                I typically read Books, watch Movies, and search various kinds of topics. I typically read books such as Mangas, Novels,and Manhwas. 
                I typically watch Animes, K-Movies, and TV-Series. I'm typically and introverted guy, 
                though I'm extroverted if I feel comfortable around that person.
            </p><br>
            <p>During high school, I typically just go study and play. I'm not serious that time and I just chill from time to time. 
                It's the good days where I just worry about nothing. Even though I miss those times, I've grown out of it and hoping for a better future. 
                I guess I might have changed, but sometimes I feel the same. So whatever, life is unexpected.
            </p><br>
            <p>Now, I'm a college student and there is a lot of things that are going to change. There are things that are new to me and new experiences that I have never experienced before. 
                I became a little bit more outgoing, I think my social skills have improved, and I learned a lot of new things. I also met new awesome friends! 
                I also learned about Java programming, Web Development, and Networking. I also gained new interests that motivates me. 
                Though sometimes it gets tiring due to some problems. I'm on a better situation now compared on my condition during the pandemic.
            </p><br>
            <p>The pandemic tested me and made me fall to depression. Sometimes, that situation still affects me today, so I hope to be better.
                 Those times made me realize so many things like, what is my real passion? That also made me realize that in the end, 
                 I'm always by myself. Since I never been in contact with my old friends. 
                 Though I cherish my current friends and they will forever be in my heart. 
                 There are people who will remain as memories, but those people are still somehow a part of your life at some point.
            </p><br>
            <p>As I'm trying new things that I have never done before. I learn that there is so much more things to life.
                 I also start to learn and assert that I'm independent. As I grow to be dependent,
                  I learn to be independent and be my own individual self. I hope reach my goals, do things that I really like, and have a better life.
                   As I say, I'm also careful with the people I surround myself since that will also lead me to develop what kind of a person I am.
            </p><br>
            <p>I plan to start working out again to be fit and healthy. I also learn to be a better person. Though I plan to stay single and have no child. 
                I still hope to be a better person if ever that one comes into my life. I cherish platonic love the most since not all kind of love must be romantic. 
                I do have crushes sometimes, but I know to myself that I am incapable. Still I try to be better, so that someday, I will be ready.
                 I am not rushing, but I wish to find who really the one is.
            </p><br>
            <p>Now, I want to lead a better life. A life of peace and doing what I really like. My friends and my family. 
                I will spend a time of my life with them. I wish to travel the world, to continuously learn, and to just be happy. 
                Our life is so limited in this world. So, I guess to spend it fully without regrets.
            </p><br>
            <p>So now, I have a lot of goals and plans and I never know which one to do. Still, it's fine since I know I can't do everything. 
                So that's why I keep exploring and enjoying the moment. I'm the kind of guy who doesn't like doing the same thing and have some variety in my life. 
                I may work in a tech company, doing web development, game development, networking, or designing. I may run a business or do streaming.
                 I may do photography since I like taking pictures of scenes that I encounter. 
                 That's why keep exploring, enjoy the moment, do things that makes you happy. Life is unpredictable so things will adjust. 
                 I don't know what I will be doing in the future and whom I'll be spending my life with. So don't fret and just enjoy the moment.
